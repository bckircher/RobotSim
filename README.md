# Scheduler
This web app is an FLL tournament scheduler, used to generate schedules, import
files for the FLL Tournament Management System, and PDFs of the schedules used
by teams, referees, and judges.  It can be run from a file in the local file
system, or served up by a web server.

This application has been developed and testing used Chrome.  Your mileage may
vary with other web browsers.

Once fully assembled, the application is in a single, fully self-contained HTML
source file.  As such, it can be used (locally) without any connection to the
Internet.
