# RobotSim

This web app is a limited LEGOÂ® robot simulator, allowing the fundamental
navigation techniques (line following and gyro driving) to be taught and
explored without the need for a physical robot (or a large area, or a field
with a line to follow around, etc.).

This application has been developed and testing used Chrome.  Your mileage may
